# Lab 02 - Input

## Lab Goal
This lab was designed to give you practice using the **Scanner** class to read input from the keyboard, store the input as variables, then write messages to the console based on the input.

## Instructions
Edit the main() method in **Input.java** to do the following:
* Instantiate a Scanner variable
* Ask the user for their name and store the result as a string.
* Ask the user for their age and store the result as an int.
* Ask the user for the year of their most recent birthday and store the result as an int.
* Calculate the year they were born.
* Output the message "Name was born in xxxx"

Make sure you modify the first line of this **Readme.md** and replace the two instances of "username" with your GitHub username.

## Grading
* 30 - Correctly received input.
* 30 - Correctly stored input as variables.
* 30 - Correct output.
* 10 - style

Note that these are potential maximums; the computer can only check so much.  If your code passes checkstyle, but I see non-descriptive variable names, then your style grade will go down.  If your code passes all tests, but I see code that was copied off of the internet or from another student your grade will go *way* down.
